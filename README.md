# MorseDecoder

Contains a program which decodes a morse code to a readable message in the english alphabet. To run the program, open the file _MorseDecoder.py_ and run it on the terminal or your IDE. Make sure your IDE decodes CTRL + C as quitting the program, and not as copying. 

The morse code is made by pressing the space bar on the keyboard. The different signals used are made as followed:

**dot** - pressing the space bar < 1 second

**dash** - pressing the space bar > 1 second

**end of symbol** - pause < 4, 7 ] seconds

**end of word** - pause > 7 seconds

**end of message** - CTRL + C
